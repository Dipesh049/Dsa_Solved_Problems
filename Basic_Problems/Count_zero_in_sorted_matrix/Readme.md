# Logic 

Here we have to count numbers of zeroes occurs in the sorted matrix and return it.

# Explaination of the code
Step-1: First created 3 variables called <mark>i, j, count</mark> which is a int type.
Step-2: Initialized i=array.length-1, j=0, count=0.
Step-3: Used a while loop with <mark>i >= 0 && j < arr[0].length</mark>. It means the loop will run according to row's length.
Step-4: Then we check that condition that <mark>array[i][j] == 0</mark> then we increase our count variable to 1 and also increase j to 1 so that execution will go at coloumn of the same row.
Step-5: If that condition will become false then decrease <mark>i with 1 and j=0</mark>.
Step-6: Return count.
